# Highlights

* Fancy "Force grab"
	* Target, hold, and than pull to get an object to fly towards you. And than catch it once it flies perfectly into your hands
	* Uses a cone shaped collider instead of the common raycast. Makes it much easier to target objects far away.
* Enhenced throwing
	* Throwing in vr is annoying, especially for controllers without finger tracking, users typically release the hold button too late. 
	* Users also like to flick their wrist when throwing. It makes the release direction down instead of forward.
	* All this is fixed with code
