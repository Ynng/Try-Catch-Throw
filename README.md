## Highlights
* Force pull "gravity glove style"
  * aim, lock, grab, pull, object flies toward you, release hand, grab again when object reaches you
  * Inspired by Half Life: Alyx
* Assisted, physically-correct, VR throwing
* Physics based controllers
  * Hands not pass through wall
* Immersive heavy objects
  * Hands move slower when holding heavier objects
  * Rewards player for imagining themselves holding heavy objects
    * If controllers move too quickly, ingame hands have less force
    * If controllers move at realistic speed, ingame hands have more force
* Procedurally generated enemy waves

### More Info
The game was suppose to be programming themed, hence the name. But then I changed theme midway to loy-poly + medieval.
